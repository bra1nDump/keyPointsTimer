# Key Points Timer

## My problem

* When I give a weekly update during one of my meetups I am all over the place
* Even when I make key points that I want to touch on - I usually fail with timing

## Solution

* Easily edit a list of key points
* Allocate time for each key point
* Visualy assist the presenter with the timing of the presentation

## Why Flutter

* Reuse code for iOS/Android/Web
* Want to use the framework at my next job
